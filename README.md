## 📌 About Vanilla JavaScript  
Vanilla JavaScript is simply **plain JavaScript** without any additional libraries or frameworks.  
It provides:  
- 🔹 Direct access to the **DOM API** for dynamic UI updates.  
- 🔹 Better performance with **zero dependencies**.  
- 🔹 A great way to strengthen **core JS skills** before diving into frameworks like React or Angular.  

By using Vanilla JS in this project, I kept the website **lightweight, fast-loading, and framework-independent** 🚀.
